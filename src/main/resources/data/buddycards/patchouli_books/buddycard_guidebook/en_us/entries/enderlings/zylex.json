Unlike their elders, the enderlings will gladly trade with it. $(br2)Zylex is an odd material, and making stuff with it is extremely hard, other then zylex blocks and tokens, you can't make much with it. $(br2)Zylex is one of the materials with trace amounts in Buddycards, and has something to do with how cards are graded."
