Thanks for checking out my mod!

A fair warning the code can get messy at times but I try to comment what I can,
so it can be understood. The mod may be a little small now, but I plan on giving
it more updates over time!

Below is a list of all the features currently in the mod

# Buddycard Sets
Every set of cards has a pack to go with it. They can be found in various ways.
Each set consists of 27 normal cards, and 27 shiny variant cards. Every pack
has 3 normal cards and 1 shiny card. There are 4 rarities of cards, which each
have lower odds of appearing. Common cards are cards #1-12 of a set. Uncommon
cards are cards #13-21 of a set, and have 2 yellow corners. Rare cards are cards
22-25 of a set, and have 4 blue corners. Mythic cards are cards #26 and #27 of
a set, and they have 2 purple corners and 2 yellow corners. Upon completing a set
you will recieve a medallion as a prize. Each set has a different medal, and at
the moment each player can only get 1 of each.

### Base Set
Packs can be found in abandoned mineshafts, buried treasure, desert pyramids,
shipwreck treasure, dungeons, villages, and bonus chests. You can also farm the
packs by killing baby variants of zombies, villagers, and zombie villagers.

### Nether Set
Packs can be found in bastions, ruined portals, and nether fortresses. You can also
farm the packs by killing baby piglins, zombified piglins, or withers. You can also
rarely get them as an extra gift while bartering.

### End Set
Packs can be found in end city chests, by killing the dragon, or as a rare drop from
Shulkers.

### Byg Set
Packs currently are obtained by combining a base set pack with rainbow eucalyptus
logs, ebony logs, therium, and embur gel.

### Create Set
Packs can only be obtained by crushing down old packs or cards into shredded
buddycards, which then must be combined with a brass sheet using a heated mixer.

### Aquaculture Set
Packs can only be caught by using a buddycard hook on a fishing rod, or by using a
buddysteel fishing rod. You can also get non shiny cards this way. You can apply
the hook to a rod using a tackle box.

### Farmers Delight Set
Packs are made using Buddybeans, a rare byproduct in vanilla and farmer's delight
crops alike. By mixing them with pork, sugar, shredded buddycards, and a canvas,
you can make a Farmer's Delight pack. You can get shredded buddycards by chopping
cards on a cutting board. You can also find non-shiny cards in crops similar to the
Buddybeans.

## Medals
Medals can be obtained when you collect all 54 cards of a set. Once you get one,
you can duplicate them by making a medal token and combining it with two matching
packs and the medal you want to duplicate. Medals can be enchanted with Buddy
Binding (see Buddy Binding section) and Buddy Boost. Buddy Boost has two levels,
and they increase the abilities of medals. These are the abilities of every medal:

## Binders
Binders can be crafted similarly to books, except with buddycards instead of paper.
The color of the binder depends on the cards used to make it. Each binder can hold
54 cards each, which means it can hold every card, including shiny variants, of a
given set. Binders can be enchanted with Buddy Binding (see Buddy Binding section)
and Extra Page. Extra Page has three levels, and each one has more card slots.
No EP - 54 slots
EP I - 72 slots
EP II - 96 slots
EP III - 120 slots
Additionally, there is also the ender binder, which can be made with 3 cards and an
eye of ender. Just like an enderchest, each player will have their own inventory in
every ender binder, so it doesn't matter if you lose it. You can also lock binders
with keys by putting the key in your offhand.

## Card Displays
Made with 1 wood plank and 6 sticks, a card display can be placed to hold 6 cards
on a wall. They come in all vanilla wood varieties. If you have Byg installed, they
also come in all byg varieties. There is also the cardstand, made with 2 buddysteel
nuggets and an iron nugget.

## Mystery Packs
Mystery packs can be made with one of any pack, combined with 2 emerald blocks, 2
iron blocks, 2 phantom membranes, and 2 diamonds. These packs contain 9 cards, 7
normal cards and 2 shiny variants. The mystery pack can include cards from every
set, wether it's possible to get those cards in your modpack or not. This allows
all cards to be obtainable.

## Buddy Binding
An enchant that you can get on medals and binders. Whenever you die and an item
with Buddy Binding on it would normally drop on the floor and eventually despawn,
it has a chance to stay in your inventory after death. This chance goes up with
every level of Buddy Binding, from 56%, to 80%, to 100%. In order to get Buddy
Binding III, you require a full enchanting setup.

## Graded Buddycards
Graded Buddycards allow you to use grading sleeves, to grade your cards. Each card
will be given a random grade, with better grades being rarer. There are 5 grades
in total: D, C, B, A, and S. While most of them are likely to be found every few
packs, an S grade means the card is in mint condition, which is extremely rare.
The grading sleeves you need to grade cards can be crafted with 2 gold, 2 iron,
and 2 glass panes, but can also be found naturally in villages, bastions, end
cities, shipwrecks, and buried treasures. Hold a grading sleeve in you offhand
and a card in your right hand, and then use the grading sleeve in order to grade
a card.

## Buddysteel
Buddysteel is a material made from smelting Buddysteel blend, made by combining
an Iron Block, Zylex, Gold, and three cards. The smelting process is reccomended to
do in a blast furnace as it takes some time. Buddysteel can make pickaxes, axes, swords,
shovels, hoes, and armor that will become more powerful as you collect more sets.
If you have aquaculture installed, you can also make a fishing rod, hook, and fillet knife
out of buddysteel. If you have Farmer's Delight installed, you can also make a Buddysteel
knife. With three buddysteel nuggets, you can make a key that lets  you lock your 
buddycard displays, binders, vaults, and stands.

## Buddysteel Vaults
Made with a binder, 4 buddysteel ingots, and 4 buddysteel nuggets, the vault is the
best storage option for cards, fitting 108 cards and 12 items inside them. They are
also lockable with keys, and are blast-proof.

## Enderlings, Zylex, and Zylex gear
Enderlings rarely spawn alongside endermen, and are much more friendly. They offer
various trades with you for buddycards, using their currency, Zylex, a mysterious
material only Endermen know how to find and work with. If you max out an enderlings
trades, you can make a zylex token with 11 zylex and 3 end set cards, and reset their
trades using it. Every third time you do this will unlock a specialty trade for Zylex
gear. The Zylex boots: their fashonable boots that work similar to buddysteel. The
Zylex bands: bands that let your fists break stuff faster, and will let you break
vaults without dropping items by holding one in each hand. Lastly, the Zylex medal:
A medal that can let you refresh their trades like tokens as many times as you want,
as well as give grading luck when enchanted with Buddy Boost.

## Config
The config file of the mod lets you change all sorts of thing. Each value goes
over what it will alter.
